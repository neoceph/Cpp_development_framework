Welcome to |projectName|'s documentation!
==========================================
|projectName| is a C++ development framework that aims to streamline the other details of building executable, versioning, packaging the program with all the necessary libraries. 
The primary objective is to allow the scientist, researcher, engineering or developer focus entirely on writing the code and worry less about environment setup.
In the current version |projectName| also provides versioning of the program from the git tags.
